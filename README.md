Stateful Authentication
What is stateful authentication?
Answer: Stateful authentication involves maintaining user session data on the server. When a user logs in, the server creates a session and stores session data, typically using cookies. Each subsequent request from the client includes the session identifier, allowing the server to retrieve the session data and authenticate the user.


What are the advantages and disadvantages of stateful authentication?
Answer:
Advantages:
Enhanced security as session data is stored on the server.
Easier to manage complex, multi-step transactions.
Disadvantages:
Requires more server resources to manage sessions.
Can be challenging to scale due to the need to maintain session state.


How does session management work in stateful authentication?
Answer: When a user logs in, the server generates a session ID and stores it along with user data in a session store (e.g., database, in-memory store). The session ID is sent to the client as a cookie. For each subsequent request, the client sends the session ID, and the server retrieves the session data to authenticate the user.

Stateless Authentication
What is stateless authentication?
Answer: Stateless authentication uses tokens (such as JWTs) that contain all the necessary information about the user. The server does not store session data; instead, the token is sent with each request, and the server verifies the token to authenticate the user.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of stateless authentication?
Answer:
Advantages:
Easier to scale as the server does not need to manage session state.
Can be more efficient in distributed systems and microservices architectures.
Disadvantages:
Requires robust security measures to protect token integrity.
Tokens can be vulnerable to theft if not properly secured.

How does JWT work in stateless authentication?
Answer: When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing user information and signs it with a secret key. The client stores the JWT and includes it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. The server verifies the JWTâ€™s signature and extracts the user information to authenticate the request.


Comparison Questions
What are the key differences between stateful and stateless authentication?
Answer:
Stateful Authentication: Maintains session data on the server, typically using cookies. Requires more server resources and can be challenging to scale.
Stateless Authentication: Uses tokens (e.g., JWTs) that contain all user information. Easier to scale and more efficient in distributed systems, but requires robust security measures.


In what scenarios would you prefer stateful authentication over stateless authentication?
Answer: Stateful authentication is preferred in high-security environments, such as banking, where maintaining session state on the server can provide enhanced security and manage complex transactions more effectively.


How can you enhance the security of stateless authentication?
Answer:
Use strong encryption for tokens.
Implement short token lifetimes and refresh tokens.
Securely store tokens on the client side.
Use HTTPS to protect token transmission.
